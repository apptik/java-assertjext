This repo contains a (very small) collection of utilities for working with link:http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/[AssertJ].  Right now there are just two:

* an adapter class to allow link:http://hamcrest.org[Hamcrest]'s `Matcher` API into AssertJ's `Condition` API.
* a shell script to convert (the most common) Hamcrest style assertThat's into corresponding AssertJ ones.

## The `Conditions` adapter

The `Conditions` adapter allows you to use Hamcrest Matchers directly within AssertJ.  That means you can write things such as:

[source,java]
----
final int actual = 3;
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.equalTo(3)));
----

and

[source,java]
----
final String actual = "how now brown cow";
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.containsString("now brown")));
----

and

[source,java]
----
final List<String> actual = Arrays.asList("how","now","brown","cow");
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.containsInAnyOrder("brown", "now", "cow", "how")));
----

The `matchedBy` is a factory method that returns the adapter; just add this static import:

[source,java]
----
import static com.danhaywood.java.assertjext.Conditions.matchedBy;
----

### Maven Dependencies

Add the following to the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.danhaywood.java</groupId>
    <artifactId>danhaywood-java-assertjext</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

## The Convert Assertions Shell Script

The `convert-hamcrest-assertions-to-assertj.sh` script is intended to be run against your source code from the command line.  It searches all files matching a pattern and replaces the most common `assertThat()` Hamcrest assertions to their corresponding AssertJ ones.

The script itself can be found link:http://github.com/danhaywood/java-assertjext/blob/master/convert-hamcrest-assertions-to-assertj.sh?raw=true[here].

Run the script from the root of the source you want to convert.  If no arguments are passed, it will search for files names `*Test.java`.  Use `-h` to see other options.

TIP: if it looks familiar then that's because it is adapted from the link:http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-converting-junit-assertions-to-assertj.html[similar script] that AssertJ provides for converting JUnit assertions.  However, `sed -i` seems to be broken on Windows, so I changed the looping to handle that.
