Suppose you have been using link:http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/[Hamcrest] for your tests, but would like to move to link:joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj[AssertJ] to take advantage of its fluent API and better "discoverability" within an IDE.  On the other hand you have a bunch of assertions that need porting over and you don't much fancy changing them all by hand.

This repo provides two tools, intended to be used together, that can help.

* a shell script to convert (the most common) Hamcrest style assertThat's into corresponding AssertJ ones.

* an adapter class to allow link:http://hamcrest.org[Hamcrest]'s `Matcher` API into AssertJ's `Condition` API.

Read on to learn more...

## The Convert Assertions Shell Script

The first tool is the `convert-hamcrest-assertions-to-assertj.sh` script.  This is intended to be run against your source code from the command line, replacing the most common `assertThat()` Hamcrest assertions to their corresponding AssertJ ones.

The script itself can be found link:http://github.com/danhaywood/java-assertjext/blob/master/convert-hamcrest-assertions-to-assertj.sh?raw=true[here].

Run the script from the root of the source you want to convert.  If no arguments are passed, it will search for files names `*Test.java`.  Use `-h` to see other options.

TIP: the script is adapted from the link:http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-converting-junit-assertions-to-assertj.html[similar script] that AssertJ provides for converting JUnit assertions.  It also fixes an issue of using `sed -i` which seems to be broken on Windows.

## The `Conditions` adapter

One of the benefits of Hamcrest, of course, is the extensibility of is `Matcher` API.  So even if most of your assertions are run of the mill simple stuff covered by the conversion script, you are bound to have some more exotic assertions too.

AssertJ itself has an API similar to Hamcrest's `Matcher`, called `Condition`.  The `Conditions` adapter provided by this repo allows you to use Hamcrest ``Matcher``s directly within AssertJ.  That means you can write things such as:

[source,java]
----
final int actual = 3;
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.equalTo(3)));
----

and

[source,java]
----
final String actual = "how now brown cow";
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.containsString("now brown")));
----

and

[source,java]
----
final List<String> actual = Arrays.asList("how","now","brown","cow");
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.containsInAnyOrder("brown", "now", "cow", "how")));
----

In the above the `matchedBy` is a factory method that returns the adapter; just add this static import:

[source,java]
----
import static com.danhaywood.java.assertjext.Conditions.matchedBy;
----

Going back to the <<The Convert Assertions Shell Script>>, if you look at the last substitution you'll see that the last sed expression actually uses this syntax.  Thus, running the script should fully migrate all of your existing Hamcrest style assertions.

At this point you then have a choice: you can either rewrite those Hamcrest assertions to corresponding AssertJ ones, or leave them as is.  You can also continue to tap into the power of Hamcrest if and when you find you can better express the intent that way (even Joel, AssertJ's maintainer, straightforwardly recognizes this, eg as in link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/26745752/56880[this Stackoverflow answer].

## Maven Dependencies

Add the following to the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.danhaywood.java</groupId>
    <artifactId>danhaywood-java-assertjext</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

I intend to release this to Maven Central.  Until then you;ll need to clone the repo and build from source directly using `mvn clean install`.

## Release Notes (using Sonatype OSSRH)

The `release.sh` script automates the release process.  It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified snapshot version

For example:

    sh release.sh 0.1.0 \
                  0.1.1-SNAPSHOT \
                  dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
                  "this is not really my passphrase"

where

* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
link:http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation].

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

    git push origin master
    git push origin 0.1.0

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update [search](http://search.maven.org).
