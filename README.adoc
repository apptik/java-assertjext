[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danhaywood/java-assertjext.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danhaywood/java-assertjext)

For the moment, this repo contains a single utility to adapt Hamcrest's Matcher API into AssertJ's Condition API.

That means you can write things such as:

[source,java]
----
final int actual = 3;
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.equalTo(3)));
----

and

[source,java]
----
final String actual = "how now brown cow";
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.containsString("now brown")));
----

and

[source,java]
----
final List<String> actual = Arrays.asList("how","now","brown","cow");
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.containsInAnyOrder("brown", "now", "cow", "how")));
----

The `matchedBy` is a factory method that returns the adapter; just add this static import:

[source,java]
----
import static com.danhaywood.java.assertjext.Conditions.matchedBy;
----

## Maven Dependencies

Add the following to the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.danhaywood.java</groupId>
    <artifactId>danhaywood-java-assertjext</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
