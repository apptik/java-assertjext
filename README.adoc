This repo contains a (very small) collection of utilities for working with link:http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/[AssertJ].  Right now there are just two:

* an adapter class to allow link:http://hamcrest.org[Hamcrest]'s `Matcher` API into AssertJ's `Condition` API.
* a shell script to convert (the most common) Hamcrest style assertThat's into corresponding AssertJ ones.

## The `Conditions` adapter

The `Conditions` adapter allows you to use Hamcrest Matchers directly within AssertJ.  That means you can write things such as:

[source,java]
----
final int actual = 3;
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.equalTo(3)));
----

and

[source,java]
----
final String actual = "how now brown cow";
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.containsString("now brown")));
----

and

[source,java]
----
final List<String> actual = Arrays.asList("how","now","brown","cow");
assertThat(actual).is(matchedBy(Matchers.containsInAnyOrder("brown", "now", "cow", "how")));
----

The `matchedBy` is a factory method that returns the adapter; just add this static import:

[source,java]
----
import static com.danhaywood.java.assertjext.Conditions.matchedBy;
----

### Maven Dependencies

Add the following to the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.danhaywood.java</groupId>
    <artifactId>danhaywood-java-assertjext</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

## The Convert Assertions Shell Script

The `convert-hamcrest-assertions-to-assertj.sh` script is intended to be run against your source code from the command line.  It searches all files matching a pattern and replaces the most common `assertThat()` Hamcrest assertions to their corresponding AssertJ ones.

The script itself can be found link:http://github.com/danhaywood/java-assertjext/blob/master/convert-hamcrest-assertions-to-assertj.sh?raw=true[here].

Run the script from the root of the source you want to convert.  If no arguments are passed, it will search for files names `*Test.java`.  Use `-h` to see other options.

TIP: if it looks familiar then that's because it is adapted from the link:http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-core-converting-junit-assertions-to-assertj.html[similar script] that AssertJ provides for converting JUnit assertions.  However, `sed -i` seems to be broken on Windows, so I changed the looping to handle that.

#### Release to Maven Central ####

The `release.sh` script automates the release process.  It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

    sh release.sh 1.0.0 \
                  1.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
                  dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
                  "this is not really my passphrase"

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
[documentation](http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html)).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

    git push origin master
    git push origin 1.0.0

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update [search](http://search.maven.org).
